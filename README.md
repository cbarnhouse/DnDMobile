# DnDMobile
A mobile app written in Xamarin to convert Dungeons and Dragons currency from copper, silver, gold, ethereum, and platinum to the equivalent copper, silver, and gold values. This one is for all those who like to keep their currency to just the standard copper, silver, gold in their games. 

# Google Play Store 
This was published on the Google Play Store and had downloads from all over the world including the USA, Canada, Belgium, even The Netherlands! I didn't keep up with the play store's localization requirements so it's no longer up. I may return to this one day.
