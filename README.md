A mobile app written in Xamarin to convert Dungeons and Dragons currency from copper, silver, gold, ethereum, and platinum to the equivalent copper, silver, and gold values. This one is for all those who like to keep their currency to just the standard copper, silver, gold in their games. This was published on the Google Play Store for awhile but I didn't keep up with the localization requirements so it's no longer up. I may return to this one day!
